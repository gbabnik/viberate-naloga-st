# ISSUES

## master.Less image&fonts static links

        --posible resolutions--
1. Manage resources in webpack.config.js like: 
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
      },
2. Changing static links to the same place

So far I just copyed Image&Fonts folder to wherewer they are needed (I know, terrrible)

# TO-DO

## Change artist uuid in the link with artis name

## + button in the subgenres section is changing size when hoovered, pushing other elements and making the html unstable




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
