# ISSUES

## master.Less image&fonts static links

        --posible resolutions--
1. Manage resources with adding fallback in webpack.config.js

2. Changing static links to the same place

So far I just copyed Image&Fonts folder to wherewer they are needed (I know, terrrible)

## RESIZING WINDOW

### Artist picture is unvisible at certain widths

### The navbar labels with links dissapear

### + button in the subgenres section is changing size when hoovered, pushing other elements and making the html unstable

# TO-DO

## Change artist uuid in the link with artis name
